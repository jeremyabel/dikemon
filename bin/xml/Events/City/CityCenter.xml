[halt]We managed to wash all the blood off your face, [delay 4]but sadly your health insurance doesn't cover anything more than that. [halt]We did heal all your Dikémon for free, [delay 4]though! [halt]Now, [delay 4]if you can't pay to fix your broken face, [delay 4]please kindly get out of here.   [end]</TEXT>
